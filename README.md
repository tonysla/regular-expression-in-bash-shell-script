# regular-expression-with-bash-script

Regular expression can also be used to extract data. The script file `regex_bash_script.sh` contains a good number of codes necessary to extract data from a web page. 

# Commands used

      curl  
      egrep  
      cut  
      sed  
      
 
 The `curl` command is used to retrive URL's, and html tags. Then you can save it as a text file to be used later to fetch the data.   
 
 
 The `egrep` command fetches the part of the data that matches with what is specified inside quotes. Type `egrep --help` on terminal on kali linux and check for more options. On the script I have used `egrep` and `egrep -o`. The `egrep -o` stands for "all that matches".
